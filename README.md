# Grin Block Archive

All grin block chain data is available via node API if you choose to run node in archive mode but it takes a long time sync and most users opt to choose run it fast-sync, pruned mode.

So somehow if you need block chain data for research or any kind of task and don't want to wait for syncing a full archive node, you can download it from this repo in chunks.

Data is in json format and zipped with [7z](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html). You can find all chunks in [releases](releases) section or with links down below.
